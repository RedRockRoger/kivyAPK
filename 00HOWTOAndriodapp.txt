File
New Notebook - 

► Setup build environment
upload KivySimple.ipynb
open Files panel by clicking folder icon on far left
right click in Files panel to upload main.py (MUST be named main.py)
create directory "data"
right click to upload lightbulb.png
move lightbulb.png into ./data

► Do the initial buildozer setup
run ipynb file commands one at a time
edit buildozer.spec
	edit "title ="  and choose the application title
	edit "package.name = " and choose the package name - NO SPACES!!!
	edit "icon.filename = ....." and replace "icon.png" with "lightbulb.png"

Worked with generic buildozer.spec!!!   Dec 2, 2022 - able to change icon to prove config changes
	Now on Dec 3, trying to absolutely prove all works before committing to Git repo,
	app builds, but errors out in trying to install on phone.  Will have to debug this.
	Going to try a much simpler "Hello World" kivy program and see if that works.
	Checking in to Git repo at this stage anyway with caveats.

get new code cell -  click on "+Code" in bar above build pane
enter:  !buildozer -v android debug logcat (press ENTER)
resulting APK will be in bin

► Download to phone
Connect phone to Win10 PC
right click on APK in bin directory and download to PC - takes a long time
	for file chooser window to appear
attach Android phone to PC via USB cable
use Windows File Explorer to copy APK to Internal Storage / Kivy Apps
	Make Kivy directory if it does not exist, name has a space in it

► Install/Run app
on phone install Files app from Google Play Store
click on Files app to open
scroll down to bottom
tap "Internal storage" 
tap Kivy Apps
tap Kivysimple...... app with lightbulb icon
tap Install (or Update)
tap INSTALL ANYWAY
tap Don't Send
Most likely as you are tapping Don't Send, the Open button will disappear
	start over tapping the lightbulb
	tap Open quickly when it appears
	After the first time tapping "Don't Send", you won't have to again
Tap in white User Name box and type some stuff - multiline acceptable
Tap on "password"
Type some stuff (will show as *******)
	When you finally type ENTER, the app is done and cannot be exited
	except by navigating back to home screen
The file in the Git project named KivySimpleA12capture.mp4 is a screen capture of
	the process of the install/run process.  Watching it before trying to do
	it will be helpful.
 


► Record phone screen via USB cable onto PC
► ► ► ► adb.exe bundled in ScrCpy can be used for debug
	access to phone logs
Download and install ScrCpy from https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy
scrcpy --record=c:\temp\A12capture.mp4 --max-fps=15


► Debug prep on phone
Settings
Tap About Phone
Tap “Software information”
Tap “Build number” seven times
Enter your pattern (i.e. 4 digit pass code), PIN or password to enable the Developer options menu
The "Developer options" menu will now appear in your Settings menu
Enable Stay Awake
Enable USB debugging

► Debug 
====> This is VERY specific to my Raspberry Pi Linux platform  <====
====> Documenting this more for myself than anybody else  <====
Connect phone to BearyPi Linux PC
IMPORTANT ===>  Note current time to be able to capture only relevant part of log
Open File Manager on phone
navigate to Internal Storage / Kivy Apps
click on app
choose install and say yes to all prompts
choose "Open" when it appears at the bottom of screen
App will fail
Open emacs as root on BearyPi
do the following commands in a shell in emacs
'adb start-server'
'adb devices'  Be sure phone is seen at this step
'adb shell'
"logcat -t '12-01 07:15:41.000' "  (but use the time your wrote down)

adb shell > c:\temp\capturelogcat.txt 2>&1
    then input logcat -t '12-03 07:30:00.000'

When enough time has gone by to have the log spit out, close the CMD window
	Log should have been closed and can be inspected

When log stops coming out, save to a file
Search for Traceback and you will find the error
